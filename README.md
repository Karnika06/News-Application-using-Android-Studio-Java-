# News-Application-using-Android-Studio-Java

In this New app, I have displayed News according to the categories like technology, science, entertainment and more. As we open our app we will get All category news. Suppose if we click on the technology category it will display all the news regarding technology. And if we click on any news a new window is opened displaying title and description of the news with a button. On clicking this button we are directed to the browser with the news link.

I have use News API for this project to fetch news data using Retrofit library. And used Picasso library to fetch images from image URLs.
